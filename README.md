An App for visually impaired people

### About the App-

Before we began the planning of the
project thought of practical problems that could occur in similar applications. One of them was
communication with the Application.

We then came up with the solution of text-to-speech. As easy as it sounds, it’s easier to operate.

### Usage
The application welcomes the user with a text note that’s going to ask which operation to perform. The user
then speaks out the operation he needs to be performed and the application asks the user to click anywhere
and open camera and point to the object. We have included four features which could be useful to a visually
impaired person (Text Detection, Expiry Date Recognition, Colour Recognition and Currency Recognition).
When the person clicks the image it returns the result through speech.

### Features


Followings things can be done using our application:


* Choosing an outfit
* Checking if your drink is consumable
* Counting the amount of money you have
* Reading out text instructions
